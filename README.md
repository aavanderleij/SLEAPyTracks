# README SLEAPyTracks #
* Version 0.2.1


## What is this repository for? ##

This is a tracker for tracking exploration behavior of the red knot. Currently trained for use on red knot exploration tests.
Runs a trained SLEAP model over multiple videos and returns tracking data as a csv file.

With the update of SLEAP version 1.3.3, SLEAP also added the option to save in CSV but this wrapper adds minor quality
of live changes.

The main differences are: 
* SLEAPyTracks will search input directory (and all subdirectories) for videos and analyze all found mp4 files
* Slight changes in CVS output

## Installation ##

SLEAPyTracks uses the SLEAP library. So first we install SLEAP using miniconda.

The following instructions are for Windows

### Install Miniconda ###

Anaconda is a Python environment manager that makes it easy to install SLEAP and its necessary dependencies without affecting other Python software on your computer.

Miniconda is a lightweight version of Anaconda. To install it:

Go to: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#latest-miniconda-installer-links

Download the latest version for your OS.

Follow the installer instructions.



### Install SLEAP ###

open "Anaconda Powershell Prompt" from the start menu

First we install SLEAP.

Copy the following line in the Anaconda powershell and press enter:

```bash
conda create -y -n sleap -c sleap -c nvidia -c conda-forge sleap=1.3.0
```

Wait until the installation is finished.

After installing SLEAP install ffmpeg by coping the following line into the shell and pressing enter:

```bash
conda install -n sleap ffmpeg
```


If you don't have git installed already, you can also install it with Miniconda:

```bash
conda install git
```


### Install SLEAPyTracks ###

Clone the SLEAPyTracks repo from GitHub

in the Anaconda powershell:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aavanderleij/SLEAPyTracks.git
```

To reinstall or update SLEAPyTracks its recommended to remove the SLEAPyTracks folder and clone the repo again.

Remember to save any tracking files you want to keep somewhere else 
## Usage ##

with the Anaconda powershell start the sleap virtual environment

```bash
conda activate sleap
```

with the Anaconda powershell go into the map for SLEAPyTracks (the location of this readme)

```bash
cd SLEAPyTracks
```
run SLEAPyTracks on the directory you want to track.
SLEAPyTracks will look for and process all mp4 video file in this directory and its subdirectories.

```bash
python SLEAPyTracks "path/to/your/video_dir/location/"
```

Default output location can be found in the input directory under "predictions/"

Files are saved as csv and .slp with the name of the video.


### more options: ###

direct output to different directory

```bash
python SLEAPyTracks "path/to/your/video_dir/location/" -o "path/to/output"
```


track more than one animal in a video (e.g 3 animals):

```bash
python SLEAPyTracks "path/to/your/video_dir/location/" -t -n 3
```
